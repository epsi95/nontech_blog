## have you found any correction?
Great, you can [create a pull request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) to help me to correct it.

This website is generated automatically using [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) templating engine.

Under [content](./content) directory you will find folders. 
Each folder represents a collection or a page where many poems are collected together.

If you open any folder, you will find files like
 - *.txt file where poems are writen. Anything in between `#### <poem here> ####` is considered an eligible poem or writing.
 - a date.date file which comtains the publication date of this collection.
 - *_img.png are the related photos of the poem.
 - preface.preface file which contains some words about the collection.

If you find any mistake tou can directly go to the collection and then the text file.
Then you can update the file and create a pull request.

#### Thank you do much ðŸ˜Š.
