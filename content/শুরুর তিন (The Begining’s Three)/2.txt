Self Talk

Dreaded by the erstwhile thoughts,
Like the whirl that plays with the stray packet of chips--
Sweeping my thoughts between two poles.

I was wandering through the long iron railings--
If I am the accumulation of the past,
Pleasure, apathy, and disgust--
How can I change my present?

The vast blue gave a sense of satisfaction,
'Cause nobody has seen the rain goes up.
