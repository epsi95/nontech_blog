The Last Walk
Though those dazzling eyes equivocated,
But the air that bore fragrance from her body–
Told it was put on for a name.

They took the road through the forest,
Where once roman chariots ruled their way–
Their glory mellowed by the dying sun,
Who was kissing on the forehead to say day’s end.

Muscle became numb, they walked for certain,
An irrepressible feeling supported by melancholy chirping–
Came to his throat, who had words to say,
Suppressed by the chaotic melodrama, that they left far behind.

In the converging woods–
“too late,” told the pale leaves,
‘Cause they knew autumn was not too far.
