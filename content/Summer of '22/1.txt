Work from 🏠

My home is in a village in West Bengal. It is a beautiful village. It was becoming so hot in Delhi, I thought to spend the days at home.
There was also another driving point. We have plenty of fruit trees like mango, jack-fruit etc. It was a pain to buy them in Delhi.
So I boarded the train and here I am enjoying fresh fruits, fish, milk and dahi 😋

There were few challenges though since I had to work with mobile hotspot I had to do a lot of <i>"can you hear me?"!</i>
I took broadband connection and now the situation is under control.
Sharing some photos of me enjoying <i>my summer of '22</i>
