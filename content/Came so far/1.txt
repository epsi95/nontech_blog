Happy 2021...

So, where are we? Well there are 2 days left to say goodbye to 2021.
Fortunately I have work from home and have enough time to contemplate on things. I went to a lonely field where the trees are not very tall. Actually it is sort of a barren field so my family decided to plant Mahogany trees there. It is winter and the sweet sunlight that was coming through the young trees is so warm.

It was abnormally silent with only birds chirping. I got to feel the presence of the present. Other times either I live in the future or feel pseudo pain over the past. The trees are planted horizontally and their geometrical shape concretized the presence of the present. I felt

<i>Oh, this is lifeâ€¦There are only a few old people left in our village, within 5 years there will be no one left. Then it will be the our parentsâ€™ generation that will be in that seniority phase, after that is ours time and it goes on and onâ€¦</i>

My mind wondered throuh many diferent things-

Although I am Hindu but my religious belief is a little weird. In the sense that I donâ€™t believe in religion, I try to assimilate good religious concepts. So I like to be religious person than to be Hindu or Muslim and Christian. It all boils down to belief. The great things about human beings are that with a firm belief they can do anything. Remember Osama Bin laden, he had some belief and was able to infect the govt. Authorities of countries such as the USA.

When I was pondering over all these, inevitably the question of the meaning of life came into my mind. And frankly we have not understood the meaning. What is understood is that the universe is vastly meaningless with pockets of pattern. It is just like if you throw some cards 2 of them will create an upside down V shape. And that is perhaps the beauty of life, you can live it the way you like, you can hold whatever belief you want to hold and live a perfectly peaceful life.

I am happy that my life unfolded many good things in last few years. Although it's been very bad years due to Covid-19 but for me, I got great opportunities.

When the new year is coming, I thought to start it afresh. So while thinking over abstract things I planned my 2022 --
<ol>
<li>I have thoughts of cutting unnecessary dramas from my life. Making life needs lean is so peaceful.</li>
<li>Learn new technology (blockchain, crypto, NFT etc.)</li>
<li>Start my YouTube channel</li>
<li>Try to find someone since I am planning to settle in 2-3 years ðŸ˜…</li>
</ol>
