Axiom

It's been a while I am walking on this earth. Every day it presents a new set of challenges and learnings. It's really difficult to deal with people. After so many dealings I have come up with a theory --

<q>People picks up entitlement faster than responsibility</q>

The more, time is passing the less goal oriented, I am becoming. It may seem odd on the face value. But if we think deeply, there is no actual goal that people are trying to achieve. We give life meaning, life itself is odorless, colorless. We make goals, we try to achieve it. Then we create new one. I am not saying it is good or bad, nor I am capable enough to say it. But we humans make a big fuss about it. We ourselves put so much value onto ourselves, that most of the human beings on this planet are overvalued.
I am little sceptical where world is moving. I myself don't know how to plough a land. I don't even remember last when I planted a tree. When I ask my parents they can point me the trees they have planted. This generation seems living inside a bubble. With so much self-respect in themselves, but no justifying them.
