In the sense that I donâ€™t believe in religion, I try to assimilate good religious concepts. So I like to be religious person than to be Hindu or Muslim and Christian. It all boils down to belief. The great things about human beings are that with a firm belief they can do anything. Remember Osama Bin laden, he had some belief and was able to infect the govt. Authorities of countries such as the USA.</div>

                  <div class="text-start my-2">When I was pondering over all these, inevitably the question of the meaning of life came into my mind. And frankly we have not understood the meaning. What is understood is that the universe is vastly meaningless with pockets of pattern. It is just like if you throw some cards 2 of them will create an upside down V shape. And that is perhaps the beauty of life, you can live it the way you like, you can hold whatever belief you want to hold and live a perfectly peaceful life.</div>
